Snow White is pretty.	1
Very, very pretty.	1
She's the prettiest of them all.	1
The Queen is jealous.	1
Very, very jealous.	1
She gives Snow White a red apple.	1
Snow White becomes sick.	1
Very, very sick.	1
She needs a prince to wake her up.	1
A handsome prince comes.	1
He comes to save her.	1
She wakes up and they are happy.	1
Far away, there is a princess in a big castle.	1
She is very pretty.	1
Her name is Snow White.	1
Snow White grows up.	1
She is kind and nice.	1
Even the squirrels and birds love her.	1
One day, the Queen dies.	1
So the King marries a new Queen.	1
But she is a witch.	1
The new Queen has a magic mirror.	1
She asks, "Mirror, who is the most beautiful?"	1
"Snow White is the most beautiful."	1
The Queen is jealous.	1
She tells a hunter, "Take her into the forest and kill her!"	1
But the hunter doesn't kill her.	1
Snow White finds a small house.	1
She is very tired.	1
So she goes into the house.	1
And she falls asleep.	1
The owners of the house come home.	1
They are seven dwarves.	1
Snow White tells them her story.	1
They say, "Poor princess, live with us."	1
The Queen asks again, "Mirror, who is the most beautiful?"	1
"Snow White is the most beautiful," answers the mirror.	1
The Queen is angry.	1
She makes a poison apple.	1
The Queen dresses like an apple seller.	1
And she goes to Snow White.	1
She says, "Eat this delicious apple."	1
Snow White eats it and falls.	1
The dwarves cry for her.	1
"Snow White, wake up!"	1
Then, a handsome prince comes.	1
The prince picks up Snow White.	1
And the apple falls out of her mouth.	1
The dwarves shout, "Hurray! Snow White is alive!"	1
"Will you marry me?"	1
"Yes, my prince."	1
They marry and live happily ever after.	1
I wish I could have human legs.	2
I wish I could be one of them.	2
I wish I could tell the truth.	2
I wish I could marry the prince.	2
If I can't¡¦ if I can't¡¦if I can't.	2
If I can't I would bless.	2
my dear prince, and I would say goodbye.	2
Goodbye my dear prince!	2
Deep inside the sea, there lived a little mermaid.	2
She was a princess who loved to see the outside world.	2
One night, she visited the seaside.	2
The mermaid went up to the surface.	2
She was so excited to see a big ship.	2
"How fantastic!"	2
In the sky, the sparkling lights were bright.	2
People in the ship were singing and dancing, and a prince was playing with a
funny dog.	2
"How handsome he is!"	2
thought the mermaid.	2
Suddenly, a big storm came up and the ship was broken down.	2
"Oh, no! He is in danger!"	2
shouted the mermaid.	2
She swam to the prince dying in the sea.	2
She took him to the seashore.	2
And, she laid him down.	2
Soon, a lady passed by the seashore.	2
And, the mermaid hid herself behind the rock.	2
The prince woke up and saw the lady.	2
He said, "Thank you for saving my life."	2
The lady took the prince to his palace.	2
The mermaid could not forget about the prince.	2
"I wish I had human legs!"	2
thought the mermaid.	2
The mermaid visited the sea witch.	2
She said, "I want human legs."	2
"Can you help me?"	2
"Sure, I can if you give me your voice."	2
The mermaid promised to give the witch her voice, and she finally got human
legs.	2
The witch shouted, "Don't forget!"	2
"If you don't marry the prince, you will become bubbles."	2
At the seashore, the prince saw the mermaid.	2
The prince said, "You look familiar."	2
"Do I know you?"	2
The mermaid wanted to say something, but her voice was totally gone.	2
Soon, the prince took the mermaid to his palace.	2
In his palace, the mermaid was happy for a while.	2
However, one day the prince showed the mermaid a lady.	2
"I'm going to marry this lady."	2
"Once she saved my life."	2
The mermaid was so sad, but she could not say anything.	2
At night, the mermaid heard her sisters.	2
They were calling the mermaid from the sea.	2
The mermaid went outside.	2
"Kill the prince, and save your life!"	2
they shouted.	2
The mermaid went into the prince's room.	2
He was sleeping peacefully.	2
She saw the prince and thought, I can't kill the prince.'	2
I would rather die.'	2
The next day, the mermaid blessed the prince's wedding.	2
Then, she jumped into the water.	2
Soon, she became bubbles in the sea, but her beautiful heart rested in peace
in heaven.	2
One little fat pig, two little fat pigs, three little fat pigs, let me in.
3
I will blow your house down, piggy.	3
Hurry, open up.	3
One little fat pig, two little fat pigs, three little fat pigs, let me in.
3
You will eat us, big bad wolf.	3
We won't let you in.	3
One little fat pig, two little fat pigs, three little fat pigs, let me in.
3
So go away you, big bad wolf.	3
We won't let you in.	3
There are three little pigs.	3
They are Biggie, Middie and Junior.	3
Each pig builds a house to keep the big bad wolf away.	3
Uh ah! Uh ah!	3
Biggie builds a house with straw.	3
And he says, "The wolf will never come in."	3
Huh cha! Huh cha!	3
Middie builds a house with wood.	3
And he says, "The wolf will never come in."	3
One two! Three four!	3
Junior builds a house with bricks.	3
And he says, "I will build a strong house."	3
So Junior builds and builds.	3
He even builds a fireplace with a chimney.	3
And Junior says, "The wolf will never come in."	3
The wolf goes to Biggie's house.	3
He huffs and puffs and "Whoo!"	3
The wolf blows the house down.	3
Biggie runs to Middie's house.	3
The wolf runs to Middie's house, too.	3
He huffs and puffs and "Whoo!"	3
The wolf blows the house down.	3
Biggie and Middie run to Junior's house.	3
"Now you are safe."	3
The wolf runs to Junior's house.	3
He huffs and puffs and "Whoo!"	3
But the house doesn't blow down.	3
The wolf looks at the house carefully.	3
"Ah ha!"	3
"I will go down the chimney!"	3
So he gets a ladder.	3
The little pigs see the wolf.	3
He is climbing onto the roof.	3
So the pigs say, "Let's make a fire!"	3
There is a big fire in the fireplace.	3
Boom!	3
The wolf falls onto the fire.	3
"Hot! Hot! Help me!"	3
The big bad wolf runs away and never comes back.	3
Open up, open up open up the door.	4
It's your, it's your,  it's your mom.	4
It's a trick, It's a trick.	4
The wolf eats the sheep.	4
Mom finds, mom finds, mom finds the wolf.	4
Open up, open up, open up the door.	4
It's your, it's your,  it's your mom.	4
It's a trick, It's a trick.	4
The wolf eats the sheep.	4
Mom finds, mom finds, mom finds the wolf.	4
There is a mama sheep with seven llittle sheep.	4
Before she goes to the market,  she says, "Don't open the door for anyone!"
4
The wolf sees the mama sheep leave.	4
He waits until she is far away.	4
Then he goes to the seven little sheep.	4
Knock! Knock!	4
The wolf knocks on the door.	4
"Who is it?" ask the sheep.	4
"Open the door! It is your Mom."	4
But the sheep see black feet  under the door.	4
They say, "You aren't our mama."	4
"She doesn't have black feet!"	4
So the wolf puts white flour on his feet.	4
"Open the door! It is your Mom."	4
The seven little sheep see white feet under the door.	4
So they open the door.	4
The wolf runs into the house.	4
"Aah! It is the wolf!"	4
The seven little sheep hide all over the house.	4
The wolf finds six little sheep one by one.	4
And he swallows them whole.	4
But he can't find the seventh sheep.	4
The seventh sheep is hiding in the clock case.	4
Cuckoo! Cuckoo, Cuckoo!'	4
As it turns three o'clock, the cuckoo comes out.	4
The cuckoo pokes the wolf's eye.	4
"Oh! My eye!"	4
The wolf screams and leaves.	4
Mama sheep comes home.	4
"Where are my babies?"	4
The seventh sheep says, "Mama, I am here!"	4
She finds him.	4
Mama sheep and the seventh sheep look for the wolf.	4
"Zzzzz, Zzzz."	4
The wolf is sleeping in the field.	4
And his stomach is huge!	4
Mama sheep cuts open the wolf's stomach with scissors.	4
"Oh, my dear!"	4
Six little sheep come out of the wolf.	4
Then, she puts stones in the wolf's stomach.	4
The wolf wakes and goes to a pond.	4
Splash!	4
He falls into the pond.	4
"Help! Help!"	4
he screams.	4
Mama and the seven little sheep laugh loudly.	4
